1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
Ans: hadoop fs -put /config/workspace/sales_order_dat.csv /tmp

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
Ans: hive>create table sales_order_csv(
         >ORDERNUMBER int,QUANTITYORDERED int,
     PRICEEACH FLOAT,ORDERLINENUMBER int,SALES float,STATUS string,QTR-ID int,MONTH_ID in
     t,YEAR_ID int,
         >PRODUCTLINE string,MSRP int,PRODUCTCODE string,PHONE string,CITY string,
     STATE,string,POSTALCODE string,COUNTRY string,TERITORY string,CONTACTLASTNAME
     string,DEALSIZE sring
         > )
         > row format delimited
         >field terminated by','
         >tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
Ans: hive>load data inpath '/tmp/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv:

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
Ans: hive>create table sales_order_orc(
         >ORDERNUMBER int,QUATITATYORDER int,PRICEEACH,float,ORDERLINENUMBER int,SALES 
     float,STATUS string,QTR_ID int,MONTH_id int,year_ID int,
         >PRODUCTLINE string,
6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
